      Hey there! My name is Katharina Mass and I'm an
      <a href="https://imd.mediencampus.h-da.de/">Interactive Media Design</a>
      student. Currently I'm working on my portfolio while learning to work with
      html and CSS. <br />
      In my free time I like drawing, reading, watching fantasie series and
      meeting my friends. <br />
      Also you'll catch me listening to music most of the time.... <br />
